## Introduction

The Media Communications Mesh (MCM) enables efficient, low-latency media transport for media microservices for Edge, Edge-to-Cloud, and both private and public Cloud environments. The framework creates a secure, standards-based media data plane for inter-microservices communications using a new media proxy leveraging the [Media Transport Library (MTL)](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Media-Transport-Library) and adds the necessary microservices control-plane communications infrastructure to implement any media control protocol.


## 1. Media Communications Mesh:

- Framework Introduction: MCM is a framework designed for low-latency media transport. It caters specifically to Edge, Edge-to-Cloud, and Cloud environments, connecting media microservices.
- Purpose: Its main role is to establish a secure media data plane for inter-microservices communication. This ensures media can be reliably transmitted across different cloud environments.
- Technological Basis: The Media Transport Library (MTL) helps form the media data plane, and a control-plane communications infrastructure adds support for media control protocols.

✅ Key point: The main goal is to enable secure, fast, and standardized media communication between microservices, regardless of the environment (Edge or Cloud).

## 2. Media Proxy Introduction:

- Core Functionality: The Media Proxy handles the routing and forwarding of media data, specifically audio and video streams, between mesh nodes.
- Low Latency & Efficiency: The focus is on ensuring low-latency and efficient usage of system resources, which is critical for real-time media applications.
- Service Mesh Role: It acts as a Data Plane component within a larger service mesh for media applications, utilizing `MTL` `ST 2110` API, `libfabric` for `RDMA` API, `MemIF` shared memory APIs, and many more, to abstract the complexities involved in efficient media transport.

✅ Key point: Media Proxy handles the data transport layer of media streams, focusing on real-time efficiency and ensuring media routing between microservices in the mesh.

✅ More information about the Media Proxy component can be found in the [media-proxy](../media-proxy/README.md) subdirectory.

## 3. SDK and FFmpeg plugins:

- Key Features: Zero Memory Copy, uses a zero-copy memory techniques for ultra-low-latency media transfers between containers. This helps avoid data duplication, reducing time and resource overhead.
- Media Stream Compatibility: Supports compressed (like JPEG XS) and RAW uncompressed media formats, ensuring flexibility in how media is transported.
- Multiple Protocols: Works with protocols such as SMPTE ST 2110 and RTSP, enhancing its versatility in different media service setups.

✅ Key point: The system is optimized for zero-copy transmission with wide protocol compatibility, ensuring it can handle both compressed and uncompressed media streams efficiently.

✅ Detailed information about MCM SDK can be found in [sdk](../sdk/README.md) directory.

✅ Detailed information about FFmpeg with MCM plugin can be found in [FFmpeg-plugin](../ffmpeg-plugin/README.md) directory.

    - MTL: Follow the [MTL setup guide](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Media-Transport-Library/blob/main/doc/build.md) for installation instructions.
    - E810 driver: Follow the [MTL NIC setup guide](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Media-Transport-Library/blob/main/doc/e810.md) for installation instructions.
    - gRPC: Refer to the [gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/cpp/quickstart/) for installation instructions.
    - Install required packages:

        - Ubuntu/Debian
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libbsd-dev cmake make libibverbs-dev librdmacm-dev dracut
        ```
        - Centos stream
        ```bash
        sudo yum install -y libbsd-devel cmake make libibverbs-devel librdmacm-devel dracut
        ```

    - Install the irdma driver and libfabric

    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup_rdma_env.sh install
    ```

    - Reboot

4. **Build the Media Proxy binary**

    To build Media Communications Mesh and make SDK available for development, run:

    ```bash
    $ ./build.sh
    ```

    By following these instructions, you'll be able to perform the basic build and installation of the Media Communications Mesh application.

### Basic usage

The program "media_proxy" and SDK library will be installed on system, after the "build.sh" script run successfully. To run "Media Proxy" execute below command:

```bash
$ media_proxy
INFO: TCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8002
INFO: gRPC Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8001
```

This will start the media proxy in blocking mode and confirm that build was successful. To close it, press `Ctrl+C`

> [!WARNING]
> Depending on your docker installation, this step may require being run as `root`.

    run bellow command from the root directory of the repository to build all of the Dockerfiles:

    ```bash
    $ ./build_docker.sh
    ```

### Basic usage

After running the `build_docker.sh` the following docker images will be available in current docker context if the script run successfully:
- `mcm/sample-app:latest`
- `mcm/media-proxy:latest`
- `mcm/ffmpeg:latest`
- `mcm/ffmpeg:6.1-latest`

Now the "Media Proxy" can be run inside the container. To check it, execute bellow command:

```bash
$ docker run --privileged -it -v /var/run/mcm:/run/mcm -v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages mcm/media-proxy:latest
INFO: TCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8002
INFO: gRPC Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8001
```

This will start the media proxy in blocking mode and confirm that build was successful. To close it, press `Ctrl+C`

## Parameters breakdown and ports

Run the media proxy:

```bash
$ media_proxy
INFO: TCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8002
INFO: gRPC Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8001
```

This will start the "Media Proxy" program. When the "Media Proxy" program launches successfully, it will open two ports to listen for control messages:
- gRPC port (default 8001) is for service mesh control plane connection.
- TCP port (default 8002) is for the connection with MCM SDK.

To get full list of all supported parameters, use the `-h` flag alongside `media_proxy` call:

```bash
$ media_proxy -h
Usage: media_proxy [OPTION]
-h, --help              Print this help and exit.
-d, --dev=dev_port      PCI device port (defaults: 0000:31:00.0).
-i, --ip=ip_address     IP address for media data transportation (defaults: 192.168.96.1).
-g, --grpc=port_number  Port number gRPC controller (defaults: 8001).
-t, --tcp=port_number   Port number for TCP socket controller (defaults: 8002).
```

## Known Issues

- There is one bug with default docker.io package installation (version 20.10.25-0ubuntu1~22.04.2) with Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS. The [`USER` command](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/46355) and [`chown` command](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/46161) don't work as expected. It's preferred to install docker-ce package following [instruction from docker community](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

- The Authentication function of the Media Proxy interfaces is currently missing. This feature is still under development, and the current implementation is weak in defending against network attacks.
