## 1. Introduction

Media Communications Mesh enables efficient, low-latency media transport for media microservices in Edge, Edge-to-Cloud, Private Cloud, and Public Cloud environments.
The framework creates a secure, standards-based media data plane for inter-microservices communications using a new media proxy leveraging the [Media Transport Library (MTL)](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Media-Transport-Library) and adds the necessary microservices control-plane communications infrastructure to implement any media control protocol.


### 1.1. Media Communications Mesh

- **Framework Introduction**: Media Communications Mesh is a framework designed for low-latency media transport. It caters specifically to Edge, Edge-to-Cloud, and Cloud environments, by connecting media microservices.
- **Purpose**: Its main role is to establish a secure data plane for media, allowing communication between microservices. This ensures media can be reliably transmitted across different environments.
- **Technological Basis**: The Media Transport Library (MTL) helps form the media data plane, and a control-plane communications infrastructure adds support for media control protocols.

✅ **Key point**: The main goal is to enable secure, fast, and standardized media communication between microservices, regardless of the environment (Edge or Cloud).

### 1.2. Media Proxy

- **Core Functionality**: The Media Proxy handles the routing and forwarding of media data, specifically audio and video streams, between mesh nodes.
- **Low Latency & Efficiency**: The focus is on ensuring low-latency and efficient usage of system resources, which is critical for real-time media applications.
- **Service Mesh Role**: It acts as a Data Plane component within a larger service mesh for media applications, utilizing `MTL` `ST 2110` API, `libfabric` for `RDMA` API, `memif` shared memory APIs, and many more, to abstract the complexities involved in efficient media transport.

✅ **Key point**: Media Proxy handles the data transport layer of media streams, focusing on real-time efficiency and ensuring media routing between microservices in the mesh.

✅ More information about the Media Proxy component can be found in the [media-proxy](../media-proxy/README.md) subdirectory.

### 1.3. SDK and FFmpeg Plugins

- **Key Features**: Zero Memory Copy, uses a zero-copy memory technique for ultra-low-latency media transfers between containers. This helps avoid data duplication, reducing time and resource overhead.
- **Media Stream Compatibility**: Supports compressed (like JPEG XS) and RAW uncompressed media formats, ensuring flexibility in how media is transported.
- **Multiple Protocols**: Works with SMPTE ST-2110 protocols, enhancing versatility in different media service setups.

✅ **Key point**: The system is optimized for zero-copy transmission with wide protocol compatibility, ensuring it can handle both compressed and uncompressed media streams efficiently.

✅ Detailed information about Media Communications Mesh SDK (further referred to as SDK) can be found in the [sdk](../sdk/README.md) directory.

✅ Detailed information about FFmpeg with Media Communications Mesh plugin can be found in the [ffmpeg-plugin](../ffmpeg-plugin/README.md) directory.

            ```bash
            ./scripts/setup_rdma_env.sh install
            ```
            > More information about libfabric installation can be found in [Building and installing libfabric from source](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric?tab=readme-ov-file#building-and-installing-libfabric-from-source).

        - Reboot

4. **Build the Media Proxy binary**

    To build Media Communications Mesh and make SDK available for development, run:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```

    By following these instructions, you'll be able to perform the basic build and installation of the Media Communications Mesh application.

### 2.2. Basic Usage – Standalone

The program "media_proxy" and SDK library will be installed on the system after the successful execution of `build.sh` script. To run Media Proxy, execute the following command:

```bash
media_proxy
```
which should result in:
```text
INFO: TCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8002
INFO: gRPC Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8001
```

This will start the Media Proxy in blocking mode and confirm that the build was successful. To close it, press `Ctrl+C`.

### 2.3. Build for Docker

- Linux server (Intel Xeon processor recommended, e.g., Sapphire Rapids).
- Network Interface Card (NIC) compatible with DPDK (e.g., Intel Ethernet Controller E810-C).
- (_Recommended_) Update NIC drivers and firmware. For more information and latest drivers, see [Support](#4-support).
- Docker engine (recommended with Buildx toolkit) configured and installed.

#### 2.3.2. Build Docker Images

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Media-Communications-Mesh.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Media-Communications-Mesh directory**

    ```bash
    cd Media-Communications-Mesh
    ```

3. **Build Docker images**

    > [!WARNING]
    > Depending on your Docker installation, this step may require being run as `root`.

    Run the command below from the root directory of the repository to build all of the Dockerfiles:

    ```bash
    ./build_docker.sh
    ```

### 2.4. Basic Usage – Docker

After running the `build_docker.sh` the following Docker images will be available in the current Docker context if the script runs successfully:
- `mcm/sample-app:latest`
- `mcm/media-proxy:latest`
- `mcm/ffmpeg:latest`
- `mcm/ffmpeg:6.1-latest`

Media Proxy can be run inside a container now. To check it, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run --privileged -it -v /var/run/mcm:/run/mcm -v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages mcm/media-proxy:latest
```
which should result in:
```text
INFO: TCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8002
INFO: gRPC Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8001
```

This will start the Media Proxy as a container and confirm that the build was successful. To close it, press `Ctrl+C`.

### 2.5. Parameters and Ports

Running the Media Proxy with:

```bash
media_proxy
```
should result in:
```text
INFO: TCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8002
INFO: gRPC Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8001
```

This will start Media Proxy with two ports opened to listen for control messages:
- gRPC port (default 8001) is for service mesh control plane connection.
- TCP port (default 8002) is for the connection with SDK.

To get the full list of all supported parameters, use the `-h` flag:

```bash
media_proxy -h
```
which should print the usage information:
```text

-h, --help              Print this help and exit.
-d, --dev=dev_port      PCI device port (defaults: 0000:31:00.0).
-i, --ip=ip_address     IP address for media data transportation (defaults: 192.168.96.1).
-g, --grpc=port_number  Port number gRPC controller (defaults: 8001).
-t, --tcp=port_number   Port number for TCP socket controller (defaults: 8002).
```

## 3. Known Issues

- There is a bug with the default docker.io package installation (version 20.10.25-0ubuntu1~22.04.2) with Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS. The [`USER` command](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/46355) and [`chown` command](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/46161) do not work as expected. It is preferred to install the `docker-ce` package, following an [instruction from Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

- The Authentication function of the Media Proxy interfaces is currently missing. This feature is still under development, and the current implementation is weak in defending against network attacks.
